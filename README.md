====================

The Mars Rover Media API (MRMA) is an open-source REST API built on top of node.js and the Express framework. It uses NeDB for filesystem database storage and Socket.io for exposing. MRMA gathers data from a variety of sources and compiles them together to provide a rich data API for the images currently being gathered by the rovers.
